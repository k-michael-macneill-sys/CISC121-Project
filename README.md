# CISC121-Project
Interactive Gradio app using Binary Search


Why I Chose Binary Search:

I chose Binary Search because it’s simple enough for me to breakdown properly without errors but a bit more interesting and visual than linear search is. It also shows examples of how algorithms can improve efficiency which is very interesting for me as a CS student. I noticed it was very easy to breakdown computational thinking pillars, especially decomposition and pattern recognition. This helps me reduce the project’s complexity as I work through this project. It’s also easy to visualize the step by step process and also to test which I think makes it ideal for showing my understanding in logic and breakdown using a Gradio interface.
